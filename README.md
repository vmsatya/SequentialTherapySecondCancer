# SequentialTherapySecondaryThyroidCancer
The IIP mathematical model is used to estimate the radiation and chemotherapy-induced 
relative risks of thyroid malignancies in four childhood cancer study survivors (CCSS) data sets. the predictions 
of radiation and chemotherapy-induced relative risks of secondary thyroid malignancies using the mathematical model 
are compared against four clinical datasets from the CCSS cohort. Moreover, the extracted average value of growth 
rate of premalignant cells is 0.8175 (per day) and the extracted chemo-induced mutation rate is of the order of 
10(âˆ’10) (per unit of chemotherapeutic dose).
